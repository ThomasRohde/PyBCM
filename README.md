PyBCM creates a `.pybcm` directory in your home folder to store user-specific data and customizations:

```
~/.pybcm/
├── settings.json     # User settings  
└── templates/        # Customizable templates for AI integration
    ├── expansion_prompt_gpt.j2  # Template for capability expansion
    └── first_level_prompt_gpt.j2 # Template for first-level capabilities
```

#### Template Customization

You can customize how PyBCM formats capabilities for AI tools by modifying the templates in `~/.pybcm/templates/`:

*   **AI Integration Templates:**
    - `expansion_prompt_gpt.j2`: Customize how capabilities are formatted for AI tools when expanding sub-capabilities
    - `first_level_prompt_gpt.j2`: Modify the format for generating first-level capabilities with AI tools

The application will:
1. Create these templates automatically on first run
2. Use your customized versions if they exist
3. Fall back to the built-in templates if a customized version doesn't exist

This allows you to:
- Tailor the capability format for specific AI tools or use cases
- Customize the structure of AI-generated responses
- Maintain your customizations across application updates

Note: This branch does not support direct API integration with AI services. Instead, it provides smart copy/paste functionality optimized for browser-based AI chat agents through customizable templates.
