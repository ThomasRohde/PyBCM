You are a highly skilled writing assistant. Your objective is to create a detailed synopsis for a report about:
{{ organisation_name }}

## Instructions & Constraints

1. **Purpose**: Provide a structured outline of the report in multiple chapters (recommended: 8 chapters or more), each focusing on a specific angle or aspect of the report.
2. **Formatting**:
   - Return the result as a JSON array.
   - Each JSON object should have two keys: 
     - `"name"` with a descript title of the chapter.
     - `"description"` with a descriptive summary of that chapter's main topic.
   - Example:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "name": "Introduction to prose writing", 
         "description": "Content of chapter ..."
       },
       {
         "name": "Choosing a subject matter", 
         "description": "Content of chapter ..."
       }
     ]
     ```
3. **Language Usage**:
   - Avoid using self-referential phrases (e.g., "In this chapter", "This chapter will cover").
   - Maintain a professional and clear writing style.
4. **Output Requirements**:
   - Provide **only** the JSON array.
   - Ensure valid JSON. **No** markdown formatting or extra commentary.
   - Use escaped whitespace in the JSON, e.g. for newlines
   - Each `"description"` entry should be concise yet informative about the chapter focus.
